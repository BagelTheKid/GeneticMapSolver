# GeneticMapSolver

## What is it?

Back when I was in University, I worked on a genetic algorithm project. The 
project allowed us to create an AI, of a specific type, that would 
accomplish a specific task. So, the group I was in chose to make a genetic 
algorithm that would solve a maze. 

The original project was made in C#, and it included the genetic algorithm and
a map generator. Since I already have a map generator, this will be focused
more on the genetic algorithm and how the genetic algorithm interprets the 
map.
